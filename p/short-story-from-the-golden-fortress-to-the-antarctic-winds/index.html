In winter, I shivered under blankets in an apartment where the maintenance fees were overdue. In summer, I survived with a single electric fan. My mother washed dishes at a restaurant, and my father disappeared somewhere when I was in middle school. College was a luxury, but I gritted my teeth and got into the computer science department at a national university. Since scholarships were my only way to pay tuition, I studied like a madman.</p><p>After graduation, I chose entrepreneurship over employment. I had an idea in my head, but nothing in my pockets. That&rsquo;s when I discovered a government startup support program. I spent two week cutting back on sleep to write a business plan and built a crude but functional prototype. On the interview day, I wore a suit I borrowed from a friend. I picked one that looked decent. This was a chance that could change my life. With a trembling voice, I explained my service to the panel of judges. Two weeks later, the acceptance notice arrived. Fifty million won. That money was the beginning of everything.</p><p>I started my business in a tiny studio apartment with just a laptop. An AI tutoring service. A platform where artificial intelligence analyzed each student&rsquo;s level according to the Korean curriculum and provided customized education. The first year was hell. The grant money quickly melted away on server costs and API fees. I survived on instant noodles, coded until 4 AM, and received hundreds of rejection emails from investors.</p><p>Then it exploded. Word spread, and users grew exponentially. Within two years, we expanded to Japan. By the third year, we had cracked the American market. When our employees exceeded 200, a giant tech company in Silicon Valley reached out. An acquisition offer.</p><p>The negotiations took six months. While lawyers and accountants exchanged numbers, I existed in a strange numbness. And on the day I signed the final contract, I was no longer the CEO of that company. The company I had built with my own hands now belonged to someone else. In return, the price of my shares was deposited into my account.</p><p>100,000,000,000.</p><p>The first time I saw that number, I felt my breath stop. The number displayed on the my mobile banking app looked less like reality and more like a perfect sculpture. Eleven zeros. It wasn&rsquo;t just a balance. It was a declaration of liberation from all the gravity that had weighed down my life.</p><p>I immediately bought the most expensive apartment in Gangnam. A penthouse overlooking the Han River. The real estate agent said this was the safest fortress in South Korea. State-of-the-art security systems, entrances completely sealed off from the outside, air purification systems that wouldn&rsquo;t let a single particle of fine dust through. I liked those words. A fortress. Yes, I wanted to be protected. From the cold of poverty, from humiliation, from the uncertainty of tomorrow.</p><p>On the first day I moved in, I stood in the middle of the living room and looked out the window. Seoul&rsquo;s night view crouched below like a beast holding its breath. The headlights of cars running along the riverside expressway flowed like red and white bloodstreams. Down there, someone was working overtime, someone was worrying about credit card bills, someone was running to catch the last subway. But here was different. Here was silent. Like a perfect vacuum, a world where all noise had been muted.</p><p>I was happy. At least for the first week.
Premium furniture found its place, and organic groceries delivered from department store food halls filled the refrigerator. I no longer needed to wake up to an alarm, no longer needed to bow my head to people I disliked. Everything was under my control. I was a victor. I had survived the great colosseum of capitalism and taken my seat in the emperor&rsquo;s viewing gallery.</p><p>But as that comfort became familiar, an unexpected visitor arrived.
It was anxiety.</p><p>It came at 3 AM. Half-asleep and thirsty, I got up and was drinking an Evian water from the refrigerator when I suddenly froze. The silence of the living room was too vast. That quietness didn&rsquo;t resemble peace—it resembled the silence of a tomb.
Suddenly, my heart began pounding. The hand holding the Evian bottle trembled slightly.</p><p>&lsquo;What if I die?&rsquo;
An absurd yet sharp question flashed through my mind.
&lsquo;What if I die tomorrow without spending all this money? From a heart attack, or an earthquake, or a war?&rsquo;</p><p>One hundred billion won didn&rsquo;t grant me immortality. Rather, it had infinitely expanded the list of things I could lose. When I was poor, all I had to lose was my worn-out pride. But now, I had too much to lose. My apartment, my bank account, my comfort, my victory.
Death was the entity that could reset all of that to zero in an instant. That fact was unbearably terrifying.</p><p>I sat on the living room sofa, hugging my knees. The number one hundred billion protected me from all the world&rsquo;s physical threats, but against the absolute violence of time, it was powerless. I was trapped in a fortress. Trapped in a fortress built of gold, I had become a guard watching the shadow called &lsquo;death&rsquo; pacing outside.</p><p>Outside the window, Seoul still sparkled. Beautiful, and therefore sadder light. I finally realized that what I had bought was not happiness, but a very expensive and glamorous anxiety.</p><p>The first method I chose to silence my anxiety was &lsquo;purchasing knowledge.&rsquo;
Just as I had bought an apartment with money, I believed I could buy salvation with money. I logged onto an online bookstore and threw into my cart every book with keywords like &lsquo;death,&rsquo; &lsquo;philosophy,&rsquo; &lsquo;religion,&rsquo; and &lsquo;afterlife.&rsquo; From Plato to Heidegger, Buddhist sutras and the Bible, the Quran, even New Age meditation books.</p><p>The next afternoon, boxes of books piled up like a tower in front of my entrance. I carried them to the living room and arranged them like building a tower. Just looking at the titles on the spines gave me a strange sense of relief. The illusion that thousands of years of human wisdom was now in my hands. I believed this fortress of printed words would protect me from the fear of death.</p><p>But the more I opened the books, the clearer my anxiety became.
Philosophers defined &rsquo;life is suffering,&rsquo; and religions taught &lsquo;abandon desire.&rsquo; Schopenhauer said that when desire is fulfilled, boredom comes, and when it isn&rsquo;t, suffering comes. I was trembling exactly between that pendulum of boredom and suffering. The books diagnosed my condition precisely but gave me no cure. They were like doctors showing me an X-ray and saying, &ldquo;See, your bone is broken.&rdquo; I needed surgery, not diagnosis.</p><p>I decided I needed to step outside the printed word. I went to see a famous Zen master. Not one in a temple deep in the mountains, but a monk who had set up a meditation center in a luxury building in the middle of the city. I promised him a large &lsquo;donation&rsquo; and secured a private meeting.
The monk&rsquo;s hands, pouring tea, were pale and elegant. I asked bluntly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of dying. I have so much, and the thought of leaving it all behind is driving me insane. What should I do?&rdquo;</p><p>The monk smiled gently and said,
&ldquo;Let go. Suffering arises because you consider what was never yours to be yours. Empty your mind, and you will be free.&rdquo;</p><p>I suppressed the urge to throw my teacup. Empty my mind? It&rsquo;s easy to empty your mind when your hands are empty. You have nothing to lose. But telling someone whose hands are full of diamonds to open their palms is the same as telling them to die. He doesn&rsquo;t know the weight of one hundred billion. He doesn&rsquo;t know the gravity that weight exerts. I returned home with disappointment. Salvation couldn&rsquo;t be bought with money. Or more precisely, the product called salvation didn&rsquo;t exist in this world.</p><p>That night, I spread a world map on the living room floor.
Seoul was too small. This city was too dense to contain my anxiety. I needed to go somewhere. Somewhere no one knew me, where the number in my bank account meant nothing. Somewhere I could become as light as dust.</p><p>I traced my finger down the map. Past the equator, across the great ocean, south, further south.
My finger stopped at an island at the bottom of the map. Tasmania. A heart-shaped, or perhaps shield-shaped island attached below Australia. And the southernmost city on that island: Hobart.</p><p>They said it was the gateway to Antarctica. The end of the world. The last harbor beyond which there was nowhere else to go.
&lsquo;If I go to the end of the world, can I see the end of my mind?&rsquo;
It wasn&rsquo;t a rational decision. But intuition whispered. That something would be different there. That at least it would be better than this suffocating golden fortress.</p><p>I booked a flight to Hobart right then and there. First class, of course. Even in the moment of escape, I couldn&rsquo;t give up the protection of money. That was my pathetic irony.</p><p>The first thing I noticed when I landed at Hobart Airport was the density of the air.
If Seoul&rsquo;s air was a thick soup packed with exhaust, noise, and desire, the air here was like crisp, cold ice water. The chill that entered deep into my lungs made me cough involuntarily.</p><p>I checked into a small hotel downtown. Not a two-million-won-per-night suite, but an ordinary room with a view of the harbor. The one hundred billion won balance was still in the smartphone in my pocket, but no one here knew it. To them, I was just an Asian tourist fumbling with English. That indifference put me at ease.</p><p>The next day, I headed to Bruny Island.
I took a ferry from Kettering harbor, south of Hobart. A short twenty-minute voyage. When I stepped off the boat, I could feel the density of civilization had clearly thinned. I drove a rental car down the island&rsquo;s only road, heading south, further south. In forty-five minutes of driving, I could count on one hand the cars I passed. In the increasingly rugged landscape, I truly felt I was heading toward the end of the world.</p><p>Where the road ended, there was a lighthouse. Cape Bruny Lighthouse. Built in 1836, it was the southernmost lighthouse in Australia. I got out of the car and walked toward the edge of the cliff.</p><p>The wind struck me.
It was the wind of the Southern Ocean, called the &lsquo;Roaring Forties.&rsquo; Wind that had traveled halfway around the earth with no obstacles. Below the cliff, waves of the Southern Ocean shattered into white foam.
It was cold. A primal cold that pierced through to the bone.</p><p>I gripped the railing and looked south. Beyond that sea, there was nothing. Only the ice continent of Antarctica. This really was the end of the world.</p><p>Before that vast and indifferent landscape, I felt a strange sensation.
One hundred billion won. Gangnam apartment. Fear of death. Anxiety.
All of it seemed to be washed away by the wind. No, not washed away—it just stopped mattering.
This wind didn&rsquo;t care whether I was rich or poor. It had no interest in whether I would die tomorrow or live a hundred years. In the grand order of the universe, human life and death, and the number called &lsquo;money&rsquo; that humans invented, were more insignificant than lichen on a rock.</p><p>In Seoul, I thought I was the protagonist of the world. That&rsquo;s why my death felt like the collapse of the world, and that&rsquo;s why I was afraid. But from here, I saw that I was nothing. Just passing dust.
Dust doesn&rsquo;t fear death. It simply exists, then disappears.</p><p>A hollow laugh escaped me. My breath scattered white into the wind and vanished.
I had struggled desperately to live, but peace of mind came the moment I accepted that I was nothing. I will die. Someday. And the hundred billion will remain. Or disappear. Either way, it&rsquo;s just a natural thing. Like the sun rising and setting.</p><p>Back from the island, I sat on a bench at Hobart harbor.
I drank a five-dollar coffee I bought from a fish and chips shop. The paper cup was hot, and the coffee was bitter. Seagulls lingered at my feet, eyeing french fry crumbs.
I took out my smartphone and opened the banking app. 100,000,000,000.
The number was still the same. But it was no longer a fortress, a god, or a curse.
Just a number. A rather large number with eleven zeros after the one.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, at least I can eat as much good food as I want.&rdquo;</p><p>I muttered to myself and took a sip of the cooling coffee.
In the salty sea breeze of the harbor, I took a deep, comfortable breath for the first time in a long while.
The anxiety hadn&rsquo;t completely disappeared. But now I understood. That even while carrying that anxiety, I could still taste the coffee I was drinking today.</p><p>That was enough. At least for now.</p></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-copyright><svg class="icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-copyright" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path stroke="none" d="M0 0h24v24H0z"/><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="9"/><path d="M14.5 9a3.5 4 0 100 6"/></svg>
